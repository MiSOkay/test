## Welcome!  
This site exists to help explain what I do. I wear a fair number of different hats professionally, and it can be difficult to paint a coherent picture of my skill set and personality through my resume. Needless to say, sales is not my strong point. I won't promise you the world, but I will calibrate your expectations within a millimeter of what's possible within your deadline and deliver on time. 

What I am good at is creating 
I’m a **data journalist, analyst, and writer** specializing in financial trends and business insights.
