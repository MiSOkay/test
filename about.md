Iâ€™m a data journalist, analyst, game designer, and writer specializing in financial, medical, and tech topics.

My skill set straddles the line between technical and liberal arts. For me, this was just a natural progression of my interests and career path. People look at me funny when I tell them there's a lot of overlap between writing code and writing text, but in both cases, you need to apply logic and syntax to create content or solve a problem. The relationship is even more cogent in the age of AI prompting, where "natural language" is tokenized and parsed mathematically by an LLM. 

All of this is an outgrowth of my love of dabbling and experimentation.
