This site exists to help explain what I do. I wear a fair number of different hats professionally, and it can be difficult to paint a coherent picture of my skill set and personality through my resume. Needless to say, sales is not my strong point.

My skill set straddles the line between technical and liberal arts. For me, this was just a natural progression of my interests and career path. People look at me funny when I tell them there's a lot of overlap between writing code and writing text, but in both cases, you need to apply logic and syntax to create content or solve a problem. The relationship is even more cogent in the age of AI prompting, where "natural language" is tokenized and parsed mathematically by an LLM.

I won't promise you the world, but I will calibrate your expectations to within a millimeter of what's possible within your deadline and deliver on time.

Iâ€™m a data journalist, analyst, and writer specializing in financial trends and business insights.
