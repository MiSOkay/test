Iâ€™m a data journalist, analyst, game designer, and writer specializing in financial, medical, and tech topics.

My skill set straddles the line between technical and liberal arts. For me, this was just a natural progression of my interests and career path. People look at me funny when I tell them there's a lot of overlap between writing code and writing text, but in both cases, you need to apply logic and syntax to create content or solve a problem. The relationship is even more cogent in the age of AI prompting, where "natural language" is tokenized and parsed mathematically by an LLM.

I won't promise you the world, but I will calibrate your expectations to within a millimeter of what's possible within your deadline and deliver on time.
