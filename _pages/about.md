# Welcome!

I am in my final year of my undergraduate studies at Tulane University in New Orleans. I am double majoring in mathematics and computer science with a management minor. I am excited about research at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and biology. I have been in collaboration with Prof. Scott McKinley at Tulane and Prof. Christine Payne at Duke University developing a statistical dashboard to automatically categorize diverse particle movement patterns in live-cell data. I also collaborate with Prof. Veronica Ciocanel, Prof. Adriana Dawes, and Prof. Scott McKinley on topological data analysis approaches for uncovering the timing of ring structure onset in filamentous networks. In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz and classical guitar and attending festivals in New Orleans.
