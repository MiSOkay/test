## Text-Types

A way of grouping texts by region of origin and time.

* The Alexandrian text-type
  * Also called the "Neutral Text" tradition; less frequently, the "Minority Text"
  * From around Alexandria, Egypt and from the Alexandrian Church
  * 2nd–4th centuries
  * Greek
  * e.g. Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus
  * Used mainly by translations after 1900

  * 3rd–9th centuries
  * Greek and Latin
  * Used for the Vetus Latina

* The Byzantine text-type
  * Also called Koinē text-type or “Majority Text” (because the Byzantines made more copies of these than of any others)
  * 5th–16th centuries
  * 95% of all the existing manuscripts
  * Used by the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire (starting on the 5th century)
  * It contains the most harmonistic readings, paraphrasing and significant additions, most of which are believed to be secondary readings

  * Used for KJV, NKJV, Tyndale, Coverdale, Geneva, Bishops’ Bible, OSB


## Novum Testamentum Graece

* Also called “Critical Text”
* Is a text compiled by a committee that examines a large number of manuscripts in order to determine which reading is most likely to be closest to the original.
