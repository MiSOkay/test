<h1>Header 1: The Words You Entered Into Your Search, Give Or Take</h1>

Search Engine Optimization, or SEO as the diviners who seek to decode the algorithmic whims of Google call it, rules over a kingdom we call Content. Regardless of whether your specialty turning is a phrase, constructing a perfectly grammatical sentence, evoking vivid imagery, cranking out thousands of words with ease, or simply describing a process with technical precision, you were united by one truth over the past decade or two. 

The Beast of Mountain View, CA must be given its due.

But what's that on the air? A wounded howl? Is the Beast mortal? And if it should die, will my Content still be Helpful?

<h2>Header 2: An Answer To A Question I Hope You Asked Containing These Words</h2>

If you clicked through (clickedthrough? clicked-through?) to here, we might have made a bargain, you and I. I provide you with an answer to whatever it is you're looking for. If I did my job well, it's a useful answer. I apologize if you were looking for a quick reference; that strikes Google as low-effort and spammy. You didn't want to read a thousand-word memoir of how my grandma organized her lifelike dolls en route to getting my recipe for chili con carne? 

I understand. I didn't particularly want to write it. You see, in the early days I might have been a demon who just constructed a list that merely contained the words you wrote. I'd then infect your browser with adware for profane reasons lost to time. Google's just making sure I'm not that guy in case he's still around.

Nobody liked that guy.

<h3>Header 3: But What Do I Get Out Of This And Other Possible Contextual Questions?</h3>

Look, I can't just GIVE my Helpful Content away! My Helpful Content takes research, thinking, and keystrokes. So while you're here, can you maybe click on one of these ads? Or maybe by the actual service my company sells. I think it's a loan, or pajamas. You'll love it. 

Not ready for that? OK, fair. Maybe you'd like a list in the meantime? Here's a visually stimulating list to break-up this wall of text. You can scroll right to it if you need to come back. Also the crawlers really like these. If I'm lucky they'll slap it right into the SERPS (Search Engine Results Page).

<h3>List Of Reasons To Make A List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visually stimulating: breaks up walls of text</li>
<li>Easy to reference: in case you want to come back again</li>
<li>Google's crawlers love 'em: if I'm lucky, this badboy will land right in the SERPS (Search Engine Results Page)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Header 2: But Wait, If The Information I Need Is In The SERPS, Why Do I Want To Come Here And Read All This Fluff?</h2>

All this Content, you mean? Semantics aside, you do raise a key point, and one that's even more salient with the arrival of AI summaries. All the information you're looking for is right there, in a quick, easily scannable format with, hopefully, minimal hallucinations. The AI model may even link back to my content in a citation, but you're probably not going to click it, are you?

This looks like a great deal for you. You get to save time and avoid all my annoying ads and affiliate links while I watch my revenue begin its gentle descent to oblivion. When creators express rage over AI plagiarism, this is essentially what they're upset about. 

<h3>Header 3: But Why Should You Care?</h3> 

Don't we have enough content, you ask? And can't AI generate most of the new content we need? What we don't have is enough relevant, updated content. That's something AI isn't especially good at generating, and I say this not just as a self-interested writer, but an efficiency nerd who wouldn't mind offloading some of his more repetitive work to an appliance. Case in point, I once had a client ask me to use ChatGPT to generate social media posts, but could I then "un-AI" the output? 

If there's one thing human brains are particularly good at, it's smelling patterns and getting bored of them. You probably have a sense of the tone of this blog post by now. I should probably wrap this up soon.  

More important, perhaps, is the need for a trust or vetting system, which is ostensibly something Google's traditional algorithms provided. You still need that for AI summaries, especially given their penchant for hallucination and dubious citation.

<h2>Header 2: Conclusion, Since I've Reached The Requisite Word Count, Plus A Call To Action</h2>

The internet needs a new bargain, one that can feed AI summaries and output without disincentivizing the creation of the content that they cite and train upon. There's an opportunity here to break away from the overly formulaic writing and formatting that's characterized the last decade ... or create a new algorithmic arms race where we all try to guess what the models want to see and write for them rather than human beings. Or maybe we engage in an all-out content turf war where we try to plant our branding deep within their corpora? 

For that matter, how many models will be left standing when all is said and done? They aren't cheap to run.

More on this topic at a later date. In the meantime, <strong>I call you to action</strong> to explore the SEO-oriented content in my portfolio.
