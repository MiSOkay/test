## Overview  
I've been writing about small business matters for a very long time, most recently at Merchant Maverick, a small business resources site. I wore a number of hats there, including senior staff writer, small business researcher and analyst, and occasionally tech advisor. 

My areas of focus were **small business payment processing and funding**. This involved gaining in-depth knowledge of credit, debit, ACH, and crypto payment systems and conveying that information in a digestible form to our audience of small business owners.

## üí¨ Notes / Reflections
Payment processing is one of those things everyone takes for granted, but it has very complex billing and security structures. Just implementing it can be a huge challenge for small businesses, which has given rise to convenient but costly "third-party processors" that do most of the legwork for you. 

Similarly, small business financing has changed a lot from the days when the average owner would just walk into a bank and ask for a loan. Non-traditional lenders increasingly dominate the space, trading convenience for higher interest rates. It's a lot to navigate while running a business.
