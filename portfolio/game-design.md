## Concept
We needed a novel design concept for a music-based game. At the time, most music games were effectively rhythm games that challenged players to identify and sync with a beat. We decided to test out the concept of a chord-based game that would help train the player's ear. In each level, a musical chord plays in the background. Players are then presented with a series of strings, each of which plays a note when touched. To pass the level, players need to cut the strings that play notes incongruent with the background music.
