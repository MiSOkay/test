<div class="callout-block">
We needed a novel design concept for a music-based game. At the time, most music games were effectively rhythm games that challenged players to identify and sync with a beat. 

We decided to test out the concept of a chord-based game that would help train the player's ear. 

In each level, a musical chord plays in the background. Players are then presented with a series of strings, each of which plays a note when touched. To pass the level, players need to cut the strings that play notes incongruent with the background music. </div>

## <span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="color: #1e3a8a;">psychology</span> Notes / Reflections
Resource constraints encouraged the small team to come up with novel solutions to challenges that arose during development. To this day it remains the only project I've worked on that was primarily sound-driven, which provided a unique opportunity to make the sound designer a core part of the system design process.
