<h2 class="section-header">Overview  </h2>
Search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the defining quirks of the last couple of decades when it comes to written content. AI summaries are currently altering the terrain around click-through rates and search engine results pages (SERP), but the demand for SEO-driven content to draw eyeballs to website-based marketing opportunities is still going strong. 
<div class="callout-block">
My areas of focus were <strong>small business payment processing and funding</strong>. This involved gaining in-depth knowledge of credit, debit, ACH, and crypto payment systems and conveying that information in a digestible form to our audience of small business owners.

## üí¨ Notes / Reflections
Payment processing is one of those things everyone takes for granted, but it has very complex billing and security structures. Just implementing it can be a huge challenge for small businesses, which has given rise to convenient but costly "third-party processors" that do most of the legwork for you. 

Similarly, small business financing has changed a lot from the days when the average owner would just walk into a bank and ask for a loan. Non-traditional lenders increasingly dominate the space, trading convenience for higher interest rates. It's a lot to navigate while running a business.
